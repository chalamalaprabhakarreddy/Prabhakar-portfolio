        "I would like to appreciate Prabhakar for all his hard work on the L1 chronic condition reports implementation for Genesys and CCA. He took the project from scratch and ran with it with minimal guidance. It was not an easy project since there were several unknowns when we started and requirements were changed multiple times. He took the time to code/test and deliver on time. Appreciate all your work Prabhakar. Thank you for all that you do." <br> ‚Äî Client Manager, Genesys Project
